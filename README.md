# Nebula Language Support

This extension provides rich language support for **Nebula**, a modern programming language that transpiles to C++. Get started with syntax highlighting for your `.neb` files right inside Visual Studio Code.

## Features

* **Syntax Highlighting:** The extension provides comprehensive syntax highlighting for Nebula source code, making it easy to read and write. It accurately colors keywords, comments, strings, operators, and other language constructs.

## Requirements

This extension has no external dependencies. It is a simple, lightweight extension that requires a recent version of Visual Studio Code.

## Scope of this Extension

This extension is specifically for syntax highlighting only. It does not include the Nebula transpiler, the Nebula Development Kit (NDK), or any other language server features like IntelliSense, code completion, or debugging support. The goal is to provide a visually friendly editing experience within VS Code.

## The Nebula Language

Nebula is an open-source project. If you're interested in the language itself, you can find the main repository and learn more about its design and goals here:
